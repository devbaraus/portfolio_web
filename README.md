# What is it

I made this website so I could display my arsenal of projects and people like you could know what I am up to.

It displays my personal and professional projects, my blog on dev community and my repositories on github.

It will always be a work in progress, so a lot of things may change.

# Technologies

- NuxtJS :green_heart:
- Tailwindcss :blue_heart:
- SCSS
- [Web API](https://github.com/devbaraus/portfolio_api) (Another repo)

# Features

- List my social media links
- List some of my repositories
- List my posts on dev community
- List my professional and personal projects

# How does it work

I didn't want to always depend on an API to have content on a page everytime a person accessed my website so I used a recent feature of NuxtJS that makes my whole website in a static website. 

It does not update it's content automatically but I also don't make new content very often and when I do just need to rebuild the front end and <span>\`voil√†\`<span> the all pages are new.

So the only need to back end is when it's in development or when the website is built,
